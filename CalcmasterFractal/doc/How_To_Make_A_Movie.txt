While viewing a Julia set or Carriveau set of a fractal, right click on the fractal and select Save as Sequence.

This creates a folder containing a series of png files exported by the SpeedFractal program under the folder in which SpeedFractal is run.

Obtain a Windows binary build of ffmpeg.exe from links found on ffmpeg.org.  https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
After unzipping the files of the build using 7-zip, place the contents of the /bin folder in a folder which is added to your PATH environment variable.

Open the folder in a Powershell terminal.  Compile the PNG files into an avi movie file by issuing the following command:

ffmpeg -framerate 10 -i 'image_1_%03d.png' out.avi

For better quality .webm format (increasing crf decreases video size):
ffmpeg -framerate = 10 -i 'image_%03d.png' -c:v libvpx-vp9 -crf 15 -b:v 0 out.webm

A series of 72 png files makes a video of about 8Mb.
