# CalcmasterFractal

![fractalsnakes](fractal_mouse.jpg) Hi!

CalcmasterFractal is a CUDA GPU-accelerated *(very fast!)* fractal and julia set generator with a Windows User Interface.

The IDE used to create the project is Visual Studio Community 2022.

The Windows user interface project, located in the the CalcmasterFractal folder, is written in C# using .NET 8 LTS.

The other project in the CalcmasterFractalDll folder is the engine which calculates the iterations array.  It's written in C++20 and requires installation of CUDA Toolkit 12.6.  It compiles (using nvcc) to a dll file which is loaded by the C# Windows UI at runtime.  New fractal formulas can be added easily by creating a new __device__ frmXxxx function in TheCalcmaster.cu and adding the parameters for the formula to the fractals.json file.

My original project which was used to generate a bitmap file series was written completely in C# and parallel processing was performed using CPU cores.  It was slow.

I've posted several [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@fractalsnakes840) on YouTube that are good examples of what this project will be capable of when I finish adding the full functionality of the original C# project to this one.

A few examples of images that can be generated by the current project are posted on the [Gallery](https://github.com/gcarriveau/CalcmasterFractal/wiki/Gallery) page in the [Wiki](https://github.com/gcarriveau/CalcmasterFractal/wiki).
